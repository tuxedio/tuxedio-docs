# Introduction

Come one, come all! Welcome to the Tuxedio API. This documentation will help
you learn to use our API to facilitate user-driven experiences.

Our primary goal is to make this documentation *as helpful as possible*, so if
there are any hiccups in your experience please get in touch so we can fix the
problems while you get back to making innovative apps.

# Signing up `POST /v1/users(.:format)`

When you sign up, you create a user account with a handle (username), email,
and password. This will be used as your means for authentication for creating,
updating, and deleting resources.

> Submit your login:

```shell
curl "http://api.tuxedo.com/v1/login.json" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"user":{"email":"me@example.com","password":"foobar123"}}'
```


# Logging in `POST /v1/login(.:format)`

When you log in, you obtain a [JWT token](http://jwt.io/) by posting your email
and password. This token is used to authethenticate you for requests. By default,
it expires after 24 hours.

> To log in, use this code:

```shell
curl "http://api.tuxedo.com/v1/login.json" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"user":{"email":"me@example.com","password":"foobar123"}}'
```

<aside class="success">
Upon successful login, you will receive a token in the response which you can
use in subsequent requests.
</aside>

# Authentication

> To authorize, just pass in the JWT Token in the header of your request.

```shell
curl "http://api.tuxedo.com/v1/experiences" \
  -H "Authentication: Bearer MY_JWT_TOKEN"
```

Kittn uses API keys to allow access to the API. You can register a new Kittn API key at our [developer portal](http://example.com/developers).


`Authentication: Bearer MY_JWT_TOKEN`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace `MY_JWT_TOKEN` with the personal JWT token that you recieved.
